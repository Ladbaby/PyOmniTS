# `tests\`

This folder contains PyOmniTS’s basic unit tests, implemented using `unittest`. 
These tests verify core functionality and help ensure that code changes during development do not introduce errors.

To run the tests, execute: `bash run_unittest.sh`

> ⚠️ Note: These unit tests validate the codebase itself and should not be confused with testing or evaluating neural network models.
